## üîß C++ doesn‚Äôt need training wheels. It just needs better handlebars.

When it comes to fine-grained development control, performance, and raw power, C++ dominates the competition.  
However, there is one area in which C++ has consistently fallen short: developer experience (DX).

While C++ has undeniable strengths, it also has:

- poor ergonomics
- unwieldy boilerplate
- excessive verbosity
- utilitarian APIs
  The result is a good language that can unfortunately be a little painful to work with.

## Introducing C-Script

> #### **TypeScript-Inspired APIs in C++**
>
> The C-Script library adorns C++ with ergonomics inspired by TypeScript.

The core philosophy is simple: "Usability **_is_** utility."  
C-Script refines and reimagines cornerstone ADTs by offering sleek interfaces that prioritize a good DX.
It blends compiled efficiency with header flexibility, preserving the high performance that C++ is known for.
Additionally, the library‚Äôs components are fully interoperable with STL containers and algorithms, for seamless integration. The result is that developers can drop any C-Script object into pre-existing C++20 code without friction.

<br>

**C-Script Offers:**

- A versatile collection of robust, generic ADTs
- A powerful String class, reimagined for both utility and comfort
- Convenient drop-in compatibility with the C++ Standard Library ‚Äì including the STL
- A developer-first perspective on C++ programming
  <br>

_C-Script is here to complement the Standard Library and enhance C++ with APIs that make DX the #1 priority._

<br>

     ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires C++20 or Newer
     The C-Script Library makes use of modern C++20 features (e.g. concepts). It will not compile with older standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use C-Script

All features of the C-Script library live under the `cpps` namespace (short for **C++ Script**).
To get started with C-Script, follow 2 simple steps.

    (1) Enable C-Script
          - Run the script under `/scripts'
            ./enable_cpps        # Unix/macOS
            .\enable_cpps.ps1    # Windows PowerShell

          - Supported runtimes: bash, node, python3, powershell.
          - The scripts are fully transparent. They simply compile 'String' and the explicit template instantiations.
            The result is a complete local install.

    (2) Then #include what you need
          - Use the pattern `<cpps/COMPONENT>` (e.g. `<cpps/String>`)
          - Pure templates are immediately ready to use.
          - Compiled classes can be used after running enable_cpps.

> #### **Pronunciation Note**
>
> For the curious, `cpps` is pronounced "sips".
> <br>
> Yes, you _could_ call it C-P-P-S, but that's like choosing S-Q-L over sequel.
>
> Don't do that yourself, _please._

## Classes

**Array**

- In TypeScript fashion, this is "secretly" a vector.  
  _So yes, I know it‚Äôs not technically an array. But TypeScript didn't care ‚Äî and neither do most devs._

**String**

- This library doesn‚Äôt reinvent `std::string`.
- It just adds convenient string utilities _atop_ `std::string`.

Plus: since the library is header-only and super tight, it‚Äôs totally reasonable to use `namespace cpps` in your project as well.  
(Because who‚Äôs still writing `using namespace std` in 2025?)

**Lists**

- Three flavors:
  - List (singly-linked)
  - DList (doubly-linked & circular)
  - CList (circular & singly-linked)

**Queues**

- Three styles included:
  - Restricted-Input Queue (cpps default)
    - Removals can happen at the front or back, but insertions are back-only
  - Deque
    - Double-Ended Queue, meaning both front and back are valid for insert and removal
  - Restricted-output queue (yeah, it‚Äôs weird)
    - A niche type of queue where inserts can happen anywhere, but removals are back-only

**Stack**

- Like a TS Array, `Array` supports several stack methods...
  - But reducing a cornerstone data structure to a couple of members in another class feels wrong.
- Also, blending Stack and Array creates a messy interface and violates ISP like crazy.  
  _(Why does a stack have iteration and random access?? It shouldn‚Äôt.)_

## Future Data Structures

The following have been identified as possible additions to the library in future versions.

| **Class**        | **Why Not Support This Type Now?**                                                                                                                 | Likelihood of Future Support |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| FixedArray<N,T\> | **_const Array<T\>_** should be pretty sufficient for many cases, so it need not be a priority to write a dedicated **_FixedAray</T>_** right now. | low                          |
| Map<Key,Value\>  | I probably should add this in the future, but for now I need make sure that all of the core ADTs are solid, well-tested, and well-documented.      | high                         |
| Tuple            | I want to finish the core ADTs before I start adding special ones.                                                                                 | medium                       |
| BitArray         | I think this might be more niche than what is neccessary for this library.                                                                         | low ?                        |
